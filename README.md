During the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become a crucial part of maintaining public health. The real-time face mask detector has potential implications for public health and safety by allowing for quick and efficient monitoring of mask-wearing compliance in public spaces. The integration of machine learning with a web-based solution can make it easier to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this research paper, we present a real-time face mask detector that is developed using machine learning with ml5.js, a web-based machine learning library, making it easily applicable in real-world situations. The detector can accurately identify individuals not wearing masks in real-world scenarios, with an average accuracy of 78.51% .This research provides a promising approach to address the need for mask-wearing compliance and public safety.
